Hi.

My name is Yuri Ximenes Martins (`yxm`, for short). I'm a Brazilian researcher and software developer. As a
researcher I work in the intersection between Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics and Philosophy, mainly
in topics related to abstraction processes. As a developer I like to follow the functional paradigm and to
automate stuff in shell scripting. 

I'm `Linux` user and I like to work so far as possible in a terminal emulator. I use `Vim` as my text editor and 
I love it! 

The GitHub repositories are organized as follows: 

* In [dev/](https://github.com/yxm-dev/dev) you will find a list with my development repositories, classified by
  its primary language. Most of them were written in `Bash`.
* [config/](https://github.com/yxm-dev/config) contains my configuration files. Currently I'm using
  [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) with [i3](https://i3wm.org/) as the windows manager. I also use
  [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) as my mail client.
* [stack/](https://github.com/yxm-dev/stack) contains a list of softwares and tools that I'm currently using or
  used in the recent past.
* In [dev.to/](https://github.com/yxm-dev/dev.to) you will find the `.md` files corresponding to the columns 
  that I write to my dev.to [profile](https://dev.to/yxm).

More information about me can be found in my website [yxmartins.me](https://yxmartins.me), which was made
with [sw.sh](https://github.com/yxm-dev/sw.sh): a simple static website creator that I developed using
[pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc).

See also my [dev.to](https://dev.to/yxm) and [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/yxmartins) profiles. For
research matters, you can take a look at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/martins_y_1.html) and [HAL](https://hal.science/search/index/?q=yuri-ximenes-martins&submit=).

I like open source projects and I'm open to collaborations. My contact is [yxm.dev@gmx.ie](mailto:yxm.dev@gmx.ie).
