Hi.

My name is Yuri Ximenes Martins (or `yxm`, for short). I'm a Brazilian research and software developer. As a
researcher I work in the intersection between Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics and Philosophy, mainly
with topics related to abstraction processes. As a developer I like to follow the functional paradigm. 

I'm also `Linux` user and I like to work so far as possible in a terminal emulator. I use `Vim` as my text
editor. I also like to automate tasks using shell script, mostly `bash`.

This GitHub profile is organized as follows: 

* In [dev/](https://github.com/yxm-dev/dev) you will find a list to my development repositories, classified by
  its primary language: `bash`, `go`, `python`, etc.
* [config/](https://github.com/yxm-dev/config) contains my configuration files. Currently I'm using
  [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) with [i3](https://i3wm.org/) as the windows manager. I also use
  [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) as my mail client.
* [stack/](https://github.com/yxm-dev/stack) contains a list of softwares and tools that I'm currently using or
  used in the recent past.
* In [dev.to/](https://github.com/yxm-dev/dev.to) you will find the `.md` files to the columns that I write in
  my dev.to [profile](https://dev.to/yxm).
* [collab/](https://github.com/yxm-dev/collab) is a space where I will share some of my experience with
  programming, `Linux` and `DevOps` tools, in the form of precise definitions and lists of questions and
  answers. The idea is to create a collaborative space, so feel free to contribute as well.
  
More information about me can be found in my website [yxmartins.me](https://yxmartins.me), which was made
with [sw.sh](https://github.com/yxm-dev/sw.sh): a simple static website creator that I developed using
[pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc).

See also my [dev.to](https://dev.to/yxm) and [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/yxmartins) profiles.

I like open source projects and I'm open to collaborate (for example, see the
[collab](https://github.com/yxm-dev/collab) project). My contact is [yxm.dev@gmx.ie](mailto:yxm.dev@gmx.ie).
