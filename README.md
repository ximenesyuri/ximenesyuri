Hi.

My name is Yuri Ximenes Martins (Yuri Ximenes or just `yx`, for short). I'm a Brazilian researcher and software developer. As a researcher I have been working in the interplay between Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics and Philosophy, mainly in topics related to abstraction processes, with an emphasis on categorical aspects.

Currently I'm working as a Software Developer at [Magalu Cloud](https://magalu.cloud).
