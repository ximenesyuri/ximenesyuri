Hi.

My name is Yuri Ximenes (`yx`, for short). I'm a Brazilian researcher and software developer. As a researcher I have been working in the interplay between Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics and Philosophy, mainly in topics related to abstraction processes, with an emphasis on categorical aspects.

Most of my repositories concerns shell scripting, mostly in `bash`. You will also find some random notes.
