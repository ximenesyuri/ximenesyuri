Hi.

My name is Yuri Ximenes Martins (`yxm`, for short). I'm a Brazilian researcher and software developer. As a researcher I work in the intersection between Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics and Philosophy, mainly in topics related to abstraction processes. As a developer I like to follow the functional paradigm and to automate stuff in shell scripting. 

I'm `Linux` user and I like to work so far as possible in a terminal emulator. I'm also a [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) lover.

The GitHub repositories in this profile are organized as follows: 

* [dev/](https://github.com/yxm-dev/dev): a list with my development repositories, classified by its primary language. Most of them were written in `Bash`.
* [config/](https://github.com/yxm-dev/config): contains my configuration files. Currently I'm using [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) with [i3](https://i3wm.org/) as the windows manager, [xterm](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html) as my terminal emulator, [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) as my text editor, and [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) as my mail client.
* [stack/](https://github.com/yxm-dev/stack): an attempt to list the softwares, packages and tools that I'm  currently using or used in the recent past.
* [proj/](https://github.com/yxm-dev/): about some projects related to development that I'm currently involved. 
* [dev.to/](https://github.com/yxm-dev/dev.to): containing the `.md` files corresponding to the columns that I write to my [dev.to profile](https://dev.to/yxm), which are, in essence, the scripts to my [youtube](https://youtube.com/@ximenesyuri) videos.

More information about me can be found in my website [yxm.me](https://yxm.me), which was made with [sw.sh](https://github.com/yxm-dev/sw.sh): a simple static website builder that I developed using [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc).
