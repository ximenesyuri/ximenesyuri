Hi.

My name is Yuri Ximenes Martins (`Yuri Ximenes` or just `yx`, for short). I'm a Brazilian researcher and software developer.

As a researcher I have been working in the interplay between Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics and Philosophy, mainly in topics related to abstraction processes, with an emphasis in categorical aspects. As a developer, I'm a devote of shell scripts and of functional programming. I also an active Linux user and a Vim lover.

Currently I'm working as a Software Developer at __Magalu Cloud__ (https://magalu.cloud).
